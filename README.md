This project uses the **Tabula Sapiens** single-cell atlas, specifically the **thymus** dataset.

  - Tabula Sapiens is comprised of single-cell transcriptomic data from "17 tissues from one donor, 14 tissues from a second donor, and five tissues from two other donors (Fig. 1). We also collected smaller numbers of tissues from a further 11 donors, creating biological replicates for nearly all tissues. The donors come from a range of ethnicities, are balanced by gender, have a mean age of 51 years, and have a variety of medical backgrounds." Thymus tissue data specifically came from two donors, TPS2 and TSP14. 

### Download Instructions
1. Go to the [Tabula Sapiens Collection](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections).
2. Locate the **thymus** dataset and download the `.h5ad` file.
3. Place the file in: data/raw 


### Notes
- Raw data files (`*.h5ad`, `*.loom`, etc.) are **not stored in this repository** to keep the repo lightweight and within GitHub limits.  
- Preprocessed files generated by the notebooks (e.g., normalized `.h5ad`) will be written to: data/processed
